## üí¨ About

  RocketNotes is a project developed by Rocketseat's Explorer course.
  Our objective is to create a simple system using modern technologies such as React, Vite, React Router DOM, Styled Components, and React Icons.

  With RocketNotes, you can register and create notes on specific subjects in an organized manner.
  You can add a title, description, links, and tags for each note, as well as edit your profile.
  You can easily modify your avatar, name, email, and password.
  I want to remind you that this project is part of the Explorer trail/course provided by Rocketseat for those who are interested.
